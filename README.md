# Light-weight-wireless-protocol (Pending docs)

#### Light weight wireless messaging protocol for low power sensor networks based on slotted aloha access method.

## Info
This is a custom low bandhwidth, low overhead light weight wireless protocol developed as a part of EE6314 project course work.
The Intitial design requirements were given by (Proff.)Dr.Jason Losh and later on the protocol was modified to include a minimal API framework with authentication and Async State machine runing in timer interrupt service routine which can interract with user application using shared buffers.

The Protocol is based on an API framework which gives it protablibity to interface with any transceiver and serial protocol. 

## Goal
* To implement a light weight wireless protocol for low power sensors in a low bandwidth network.
* To implement client and server state machines with API framework for portbality and easy development.
* To support a framework of an application level protocol over the underlying wireless protocol.
* To implement a gateway state machine for protocol translation to standard network protocols like TCP, UDP etc.
